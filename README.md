# Titanic_MachineLearningFromDisaster

### How can we use data to predict the survivors of the Titanic sinkage?

The goal of this notebook is to dip a toe into the world of data science and deep learning. We attempt use a neural network to predict the survivors of the Titanic sinkage as well as analyzing and visualizing the data.

Approaches explored are: does age/gender/passenger class affect the chances of survival? What loss function is ideal for our neural network(mean squared error/categorical cross entropy/binary cross entropy)? What activations work best with our network(sigmoid, ReLu, softmax)? 

### Dependancies
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Keras
